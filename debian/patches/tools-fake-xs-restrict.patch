Description: Re-introduce fake xs_restrict API call
 libxenstore cannot remove an API function without changing its version
 number. As long as we want to remain with 3.0 we have to keep it around.
 Debian might decide to increment the version at some point but we do not
 know how and when. So for now keep the version stable.
